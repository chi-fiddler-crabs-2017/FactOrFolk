### User Stories

- Users can post questions.  Other users can answer them.
- Users can comment on both questions and answers.  Like StackOverflow, the comments should just be displayed in a flat list.
- The user who posted a question can declare one of the user-submitted answers to be the best answer.
- Users can upvote and downvote questions, answers, and commentsâ€”only one vote per user for each question, answer, and comment.
- Users cannot add a question, answer, or comment or vote unless they're logged in, but they can view all of the above when logged out.
- *Stretch:*  Sort answers with the answer selected as the best answer first, followed by the most highly voted.  Sort comments chronologically with oldest first.
- *Stretch:*  Users can see questions sorted three ways: highest-voted, most recent, and "trending".
